# NYTimes

I have used MVP architecture in this project.
Contains two fragments, one of which shows the list of articles and the other shows the details.

Used dependency injection like Dagger

Used RxJava for Api calls and cache data

Used Room for cache data.

In this project, it fetches articles from NYTimes Api.
